by a slew of welfare schemes such as Jagananna Amma Vodi, Navaratnalu.[53] Jagananna Amma Vodi provides financial assistance for mothers or 
guardians from the Below Poverty Line, to educate their children.[54][55] Navaratnalu is a collection of nine welfare schemes covering farmers, 
women, medical and health, education and Special Category Status.[53] He scrapped the plans for a new capital at Amaravati, proposed by the former
TDP government, and has proposed three different capitals for the judicial, administrative and legislative branches at Kurnool, Amaravati and 
Visakhapatnam respectively.[56] The proposal resulted in widespread protests by the farmers of Amaravati.[57] The Andhra Pradesh High Court in a 
March 2022 ruling directed the Government of Andhra Pradesh to continue developing Amaravati and adjudicated that the government "lacked the 
competence to make any legislation for shifting, bifurcating or trifurcating the capital".[58]
